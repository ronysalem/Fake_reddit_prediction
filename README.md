# Fake News Detection on Reddit Posts

## Problem Statement

Fake news has become a growing concern in today's digital age, with social media platforms like Reddit being a major source of information. The spread of misinformation can have significant social, political, and economic implications. In this project, we aim to address this issue by developing a model to detect fake news in Reddit posts based on their titles.

## Input

The input data consists of Reddit posts, specifically the titles of these posts.

## Output

The model's output is a binary classification, indicating whether a Reddit post is real (not fake) or fake.

## Challenges

- Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the data involves tasks such as removing special characters, handling whitespace, and ensuring data quality.
- Model Selection: Identifying the best machine learning algorithm to accurately classify posts as real or fake.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance by selecting the most appropriate hyperparameters.
- Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using relevant evaluation metrics.
- Interpretability: Understanding the features and factors contributing to the model's predictions.

## Data Mining Function

This project involves text classification, a form of supervised machine learning where we train a model to classify text data into predefined categories, in this case, real or fake news.

## Impact

The primary impact of this project is the detection of fake news on Reddit, thereby helping users make more informed decisions and reducing the spread of false information.

## Optimal Solution

After conducting experiments and tuning hyperparameters, the optimal solution for this problem is a Logistic Regression model. It utilizes word embeddings and random search, delivering a public score of 0.85532, indicating a high level of accuracy in identifying fake news.

## Code Overview

### Importing Libraries

I start by importing necessary Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization, including pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and seaborn. Additionally, we import specific libraries like scikit-learn, nltk, and more for data preprocessing and modeling.

### Loading the Data

I load the dataset from Google Drive. The dataset contains both training and test data, with the training data labeled as real or fake.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- I clean the text data, removing HTML tags, non-alphabet characters, and single-character words.
- I use stemming and lowercasing to standardize the text.
- Stop words and punctuation are removed as part of data preprocessing.
- The cleaned data is stored in a new column, 'text_clean'.

### Splitting the Data

The dataset is split into training and validation sets for model development and evaluation.

### Model Trials

We conduct multiple model trials to find the best approach:

| Trial Number | Classifier           | Search     | Parameters                                       | Accuracy  |
|--------------|---------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| 1            | Logistic Regression | Random CV  | N-gram range, max_df, min_df                    | 0.81155   |
| 2            | XGBoosting          | Random CV  | N-gram range, max_df, min_df, learning rate, n_estimators | 0.78612   |
| 3            | Logistic Regression | Grid CV    | N-gram range, max_df, min_df, logistic penalty  | 0.83756   |
| 4            | Logistic Regression | Random CV  | N-gram range, max_df, min_df                    | 0.85532   |
| 5            | XGBoosting          | Random CV  | N-gram range, max_df, min_df                    | 0.77701   |

**Observations**: Logistic Regression with word embedding and random search achieved the highest accuracy. The choice of preprocessing techniques and classifiers significantly impacts the model's performance.

### Different Preprocessing Using Embedding

We explore different preprocessing techniques using word embedding.

4. **Fourth Trial**:
   - Classifier: Logistic Regression
   - Search: Random search
   - Parameters: N-gram range, max_df, and min_df
   - Score: 0.85532

**Observations**: Using embedding provides the optimal preprocessing technique.

### Additional Trial

5. **Fifth Trial**:
   - Classifier: XGBoosting
   - Search: Random search
   - Parameters: N-gram range, max_df, and min_df
   - Score: 0.77701


## Conclusion

The goal of this project was to spot fake news on Reddit, and I tried different ways to do it. The best method turned out to be using Logistic Regression with specific settings. It got an accuracy score of 0.85532, meaning it's quite good at telling real news from fake news.

This project is a starting point to fight fake news on social media. By fine-tuning methods, we can help people make better choices online. We can make this solution even better with more data and improved techniques.

## Problem Formulation

This project focuses on classifying Reddit posts as either real or fake news based on their titles. The rise of fake news on social networks, such as Reddit, has had significant societal impacts, especially in the political domain. This project aims to predict whether a Reddit post is real or fake by analyzing its title.

## Input

- Text Column/Post (Title of Reddit Posts)

## Output

- Binary Classification: Whether the Post is Real or Fake

## Challenges

- Data Cleaning: Removing whitespaces and special characters.
- Classification: Identifying patterns to distinguish between real and fake news.

## Data Mining Function

- Text Classification (Supervised Learning)

## Impact

- Detecting and mitigating the spread of false information and fake news on social platforms.

## Optimal Solution

The optimal solution for this task was achieved using Logistic Regression with text embedding and Random Search, delivering a public score of 0.85532.

## Importing Libraries

```python
# Useful Imports
%matplotlib inline
